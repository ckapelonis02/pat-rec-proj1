# Project: Statistical Modeling and Pattern Recognition

This project is the first part of the *Statistical Modeling and Pattern Recognition* course.

Part of the code was given by our professor Diakoloukas Vasilis.

It is implemented in Matlab mainly, but Python also, and covers the fundamentals of the subject:

1. Principal Component Analysis
2. Linear Discriminant Analysis
3. PCA vs LDA
4. Bayes 
5. Feature extractions and Bayes Classifier
